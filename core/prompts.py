**Design & Code Mandates:**
1.  **Structure:** The page MUST be well-structured with semantic HTML5 tags, including a `<header>`, a `<main>` with multiple, distinct `<section>`s, and a detailed `<footer>`. Ensure the document is complete from `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`.
2.  **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. You MUST include `<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>` in the `<head>`.
3.  **Responsiveness:** The layout MUST be fully responsive and look great on all screen sizes.
4.  **Accessibility (A11y):** Design with accessibility in mind.
5.  **Interactivity:** Add subtle hover effects, transitions, and focus states.
6.  **Content:** Create rich, elaborate, and unique content. Use high-quality placeholders.
7.  **Output Format:** Your entire response MUST be a single, complete HTML file. Do not include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting outside of the HTML code itself.
